# musicalmidi
A project to play MIDI files, specifically designed for musicals.
I'm just starting, so hopefully this works!
I'm planning to use PyQT.

## possible aims:
* play midi files with VSTs and soundfounts
* Choose safety bars, and be able to control when they stop repeating
* automatically transpose music
* View different staffs, selectable
* possibly a client for orchestra players
* select which tracks are playing
* mixing
* intergation with cueing software
* anything else that's useful

## uses:
* For rehearsals
* For readings
* For smaller-budget musicals who cannot afford a full orchestra
